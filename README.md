1. Count Digits, Letters, and Special Characters

Ask the user to enter a string. Count how many letters, digits, and special characters it has.

Hint: use isalpha(), isdigit(), and else.



2. Numbers Divisible by 4 or 6 (But Not Both)

Input a range (start, end) and print numbers divisible by 4 or 6 — but not both.

Hint: use logical operators and, or, not.

Example:

Input → 1, 30

Output → 4, 6, 8, 16, 18, 20, 28, 30



3. Count Uppercase and Lowercase Letters

Input a sentence and count how many characters are uppercase and lowercase.

Hint: use isupper() and islower().



4. Replace Vowels with ‘*’

Ask for a word and print it again, but every vowel (a, e, i, o, u) should be replaced with *.

Example: "education" → "*d*c*t**n"



5. Find Sum of Numbers Entered in a String

Input a string that contains letters and numbers mixed (like "a1b2c3") and find the sum of digits inside it.

Example: "a1b2c3" → 6



6. Count Words Starting with a Vowel

Input a sentence and count how many words begin with a vowel.

Example: "An apple is on the table" → 3



7. Display Numbers with Sum of Digits Even

Ask for a range (start, end) and print only those numbers whose sum of digits is even.

Example: Between 10–30 → prints numbers like 11 (1+1=2), 13 (1+3=4), etc.



8. Character Frequency (Sorted)

Input a string and print each unique character with its count, sorted alphabetically.

Example: "banana" →

a: 3

b: 1

n: 2



9. Numbers Having 3 as a Digit

Ask the user for start and end, and print all numbers that contain the digit 3.

Example: 1–40 → 3, 13, 23, 30–39



10. Complex Divisibility with Digit Logic

Ask the user for two integers: start and end.

Using a for loop, print all numbers in that range that satisfy all these conditions:

The number is divisible by 4 or 6 (but not both)
The sum of its digits is odd
The number is not divisible by 9
Example:

Input → start = 10, end = 100

Output → 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100
